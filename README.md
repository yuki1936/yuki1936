# Hi, I'm yuki1936 (or neri) 👋

A minimalist developer passionate about performance, simplicity, and keyboard-driven workflows.  
The name "neri" comes from a visual novel character I really like.

## 🧭 About Me

I build tools and environments that stay out of your way and make workflows seamless.  

- 🖥️ Daily driver: **Arch Linux + Sway (ex-i3wm) + Wayland + foot**  
- 💻 Main languages: **Rust**, **Python**, formerly **C** and **Java**  
- 🧠 Philosophy: Minimalism, performance-first, keyboard-centric — GUI only when absolutely necessary

I don’t have public projects here yet — just quietly crafting.  
*Or maybe I'm making really fast, minimal... trash.* 😄

## 🔧 My Toolkit

- **Terminal:** fish, helix, yazi, btop  
- **Editor:** Neovim / Helix  
- **Workflow:** 100% keyboard, TUI-first, no mouse

---

## 🏁 Goals

- Build tools that *don’t need a GUI*  
- Engineer a computing environment that *disappears behind the work*
